Generally the program acts due to the algorithm provided below, which is easy enough
(smaller blocks such as error-checkins, concrete realistaions of operations are ommited):


1)
Read in description of Turing's Machine from a file:
	file -> stripe			# tape content
	file -> pos				# head position
	file -> state			# initial state
	file -> halting-state
	file -> transition-state,
		 -> transition-if-char,
		 -> transition-write,
		 -> transition-new-state,
		 -> transition->direction
2)
Main cycle:
	WHILE  state != halting-state  DO
		i <- MATCH  state,stripe[pos]  WITH  transition-state,transition-if-char
		IF  i  not found  THEN
			Exit program (there is no appropriate rule)
		END IF
		stripe[pos] <- transition-write[i]
		state <- transition-new-state[i]
		pos   <- pos + transition-direction[i]
	END WHILE

3) Print out resulting tape content
